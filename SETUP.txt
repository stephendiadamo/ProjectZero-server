WINDOWS SETUP 

Setting up host

- Install WAMP from http://www.wampserver.com/en/
  WAMP is an Apache host that will interpret PHP.

- From the task bar, under Apache access the httpd.conf file. Change the line that says "Listen 80" to "Listen  
8080"

  This will change the default port number since there is usually a program tha already is using port 80 such
  as Skype.
  
- Start All Services
- Put Online

That should turn the server on, and the icon should turn green. From there, by going to: http://localhost:8080 
in a browser should bring up the admin page.

Setting up database

- In the adminpage of WAMP, click the link called "phpmyadmin"
- Click the SQL tab near the top of the screen which will bring up a page with a text box
- Copy the script from the database_script.sql file and paste it into that text box. 
- Click "Go"
 
You should see a new database appear on the left panel that is called "pharaqr"

Accessing the server

- In WAMP, there is a folder called "www" which can be accessed by clicking "www directory" in the WAMP icon. 
- Place the project in this folder as any file in this folder will be hosted 
- An example of accessing a page would look like: 

http://localhost:8080/ProjectZero-server/index.php/QRCodeGen/generate/?code=HelloWorld
That should generate a QR code. 

Side note: 
index.php - Default page that handles most of the routing and things like that
QRCodeGen - The controller that has the functionality of the server
gererate - A function that will look for "code" in the _GET super global array and generate a QR code with its
value

Editing the code

Personally I use Eclipse because the project contains quite a few files that come with CodeIgniter, but some
people say NetBeans is better for web development. 

I firstly cloned the git repo into the "www" folder and then opened a previously created project in Eclipse. 
Might take a few attempts and some tinkering. Also, Eclipse doesn't automatically do text highlighting with
PHP. A plugin is required. I was lazy and didn't install it, but it is pretty helpful.
